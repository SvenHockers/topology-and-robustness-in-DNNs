# Experimental Setup:
Model weights have been forozen, attack parameters only differ in epsilon values.

Entry point of the experiments have been set to "sensible" parameters but due to Baysian optimisation this will be optimised anyways so entrypoints are less important than the number of trails we let the baysian run.
