# Ablation: query-anchored filtration for topology features.

# Goal: make the query point have an outsized influence on PH summaries by using a
# query-anchored distance-matrix filtration (see src/topology_features.py).
# Downstream detector is unchanged: topology summaries -> Mahalanobis score -> quantile threshold.
