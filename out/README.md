# Experimental Results

This directory contains the final runs done, they contain a bunch of graphs and store raw data like feature vectors, splits, run history, etc.
So we have used this raw data in combination with post hoc analyses tools also found in this repository to analyse these results further.

## Structure
Furthermore, the results are structured by there dataset and then the experiment type ('baseline' = geometric features only, 'topology_only' = topology features, 'ood' = ood samples instead of adversarial)

NOTE: the _analyses directory are post-hoc analyses done on the raw data
